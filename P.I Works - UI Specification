General Requirements

	1.	The interface should allow admins to manage users by adding, editing, and filtering them.
	2.	Users should be able to toggle between displaying and hiding disabled users.
	3.	The interface will have components for creating new users and viewing a list of existing users.
	4.	Validation should be applied on fields when creating or editing a user (e.g., required fields, correct email format).

UI Components

	•	Columns:
	•	ID: Unique identifier for each user.
	•	User Name: Displays the username of the user.
	•	Email: Shows the email address of the user.
	•	Enabled: Indicates whether the user is active (true/false).
	•	Filter Options:
	•	Filtering functionality for each column (e.g., by username, email, enabled status).
	•	Checkbox - Hide Disabled Users:
	•	This checkbox allows users to hide or show disabled users.
	•	When checked, only users with Enabled = true will be displayed.

2. New User Panel

	•	Fields:
	•	Username: A text field to input the username (required).
	•	Display Name: A text field to input the full name of the user (optional).
	•	Phone: A text field for entering the phone number (optional).
	•	Email: A text field for entering the email address (required).
	•	User Roles: A dropdown menu to assign a role to the user. Options are:
	  + Guest
		+ Admin
		+ SuperAdmin
	•	Enabled: A checkbox to mark the user as active or inactive (checked for active).
	•	Buttons:
    + New User: Opens a form in the “New User” panel for creating a new user.
		+ Save User: Saves the new user or updates an existing user when clicked. Validates all required fields.


Initial Page State

	•	The page loads with all enabled users displayed.
	•	The “Hide Disabled User” checkbox is checked by default.
	•	The “New User” panel is collapsed or empty unless the “New User” button is clicked.

Behavior

1. Adding a New User

	•	When the admin clicks the “New User” button:
	•	The “New User” panel is shown, with all fields empty.
	•	The “Save User” button is enabled when all the required fields are filled.
	•	The admin fills in the required fields:
		- The form is validated upon clicking “Save User.”
		- If validation fails, an error message is displayed next to the corresponding field.
		- If successful, the new user is added to the table, and the form is cleared.

2. Editing a User

	•	Admins can click on an existing user in the table to populate the “New User” panel with that user’s data.
	•	The “Save User” button updates the user information in the system.
	•	Once edited, the table is updated with the new values.

3. Filtering Users

	•	Admins can filter the list using the text inputs in each column header.
  • When the admin clicks on the filtering symbol of each column, a text box opens in front of it to filter that column.
	•	For example, typing in the “User Name” filter will show only users whose names match the typed value.

4. Hiding Disabled Users

	•	Checking the “Hide Disabled User” checkbox removes all users with Enabled as false from the list.
	•	Unchecking the checkbox restores the full list, including disabled users.
